# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hard work) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.

Ask for a review, do not merge directly to `master`. 

Releasing a new version will be handled by the developers of CleverTap, we will try to incorporate your PRs as regularly as possible.

Thank you!
